Project Setup Instructions

To run this project, follow these steps:  

1. Train the Model  
   - The Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) source file is uploaded. You must train the model using this file.  

2. Create the Required Folders and Organize Files as Follows:  

   - i Create a folder named `.idea`, then add the following files inside it:  
     - All HTML files  
     - IML file  
     - Git source files  
     - Inside `.idea`, create another folder named `inspectionProfile` and add an HTML file named `profile_setting`.  

   - ii. Create a folder named `artifacts`, then add the following files:  
     - All images (e.g., background images)  
     - Class-related Python files (`.py`)  
     - Confusion matrix and other related images  

   - iii. After generating the trained model, create a folder named `model` and save the trained model file inside it with the name `model.h5`.  

   - iv. (Optional) Create a folder named `notebook` and add:  
     - Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files  
     - Dataset files  

   - v. Leave the `main.py` file outside all folders in the root directory.
